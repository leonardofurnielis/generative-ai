Review 1: I started my loan process toward securing a VA loan. I was waiting for a a month and a
couple weeks, then I was told that the VA needed to acquire my retirement points to
verify my veteran status. If I knew this is what my loan was on hold for, I could have
contacted the VA office right away and got this cleared up. For whatever reason, it took
the underwriting department a long time to verify my employment status, even after I
uploaded a couple years of my W2 forms from both of my jobs, and they had my Social
Security number to further verify my employment status. My loan completion date was
extended, because I wasn't made aware that they were waiting for my VA status to be
approved. The push back for my mortgage is common for mortgage companies, but this
caused my interest rate to go up. Then, the securing of a closing lawyer being made
aware to me and the lawyer needing three days to get their end prepared for me to go
to their office to sign the paperwork wasn't made aware to me. My loan missed the
second closing date. For whatever reason, the locked in interest rate jumped up 5/8
points. After making the banker I was working with aware of this, he didn't understand
why the locked in interest rate jumped up either. He was nice enough to work on it and
was able to get the interest rate down in 1/4 of a point, so my mortgage has an interest
rate that is 3/8 of a point higher than my locked in interest rate in the beginning of this
process. Although my interest rate is higher than the locked in interest point, at the
end, the mortgage is successfully finished.

Expected output: negative

Review 2: I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep disappointment
and frustration regarding my recent loan application experience with your institution.
While I understand that creditworthiness plays a significant role in the approval
process, I am troubled by the lack of communication and transparency throughout the
entire journey.
From the outset, I believed that I had a strong chance of securing the loan I applied for.
However, to my surprise and dismay, my loan application was rejected due to my bad
credit history. What troubles me most is that this crucial information was not
communicated to me by you or any other member of your team. As an applicant, I had
a right to be informed promptly about any setbacks or challenges that could potentially
impact the outcome of my application.
Had I been made aware of the issues with my credit, I could have taken immediate
action to rectify the situation. I would have appreciated an open and honest discussion
about the concerns surrounding my creditworthiness. Instead, I was left in the dark,
unaware that my dreams of obtaining the loan were rapidly fading.
Furthermore, the lack of transparency is not the only aspect of this experience that has
left me disheartened. Throughout the application process, I provided all the required
documentation promptly and diligently. I expected a level of professionalism that
would include timely updates and proactive communication regarding the progress of
my application. Regrettably, I found myself repeatedly following up for information,
only to be met with vague responses and delayed replies.
As a valued customer, I expected better treatment from your institution. The failure to
inform me about the detrimental impact of my bad credit and the overall lack of
communication have not only caused immense frustration but have also wasted
valuable time and effort. I trusted your expertise and guidance throughout this
process, only to be let down by the absence of effective communication channels.
I believe that clear communication is the cornerstone of any successful business
relationship. Had I received timely and accurate updates regarding my loan
application, I would have been able to explore alternative options or address the credit
concerns more proactively. Instead, I was left feeling deceived and abandoned.
I sincerely hope that you will take this feedback seriously and reevaluate your internal
procedures. Improving communication practices and ensuring transparency will not
only enhance the customer experience but also promote trust and loyalty. As a
prospective borrower, I genuinely believe in the value of constructive criticism and
hope that my feedback will contribute to the improvement of your loan application
process. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take the necessary
steps to address these concerns and prevent such disappointments from happening in
the future.

Expected output: negative

Review 3: I recently went through the home loan process, and I must say it was a smooth and
efficient experience. From the initial application to the final closing, the loan officer
guided me every step of the way, ensuring all my questions were answered. The
communication was excellent, with timely updates on the progress of my loan. The
team was highly professional and dedicated to getting me the best possible terms.
They worked diligently to secure a competitive interest rate, and the loan was
completed within the expected timeframe. I am extremely satisfied with the service
provided and would highly recommend their home loan services to anyone in need of
financing.

Expected output: positive
